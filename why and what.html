<h3> <p style="color:Blue;">Why this <s>Kolaveri di</s> webpage?</p></h3>
<h4><p>In 2022, I struggled more than A. Pandey while trying to find out the merit lists. All I could do was to take screenshots of YouTube videos and make my phone a mess. So, I thought that it would be nice to have a centralised database of all the merit lists.</p></h4>
<h3> <p style="color:Blue;">What can you do?</p></h3>
<h4><p>You can do Anything. But fix my grammatical mistakes first. If I have missed some of the merit lists than you can <a href="mailto:sbus+osm@simplelogin.co">MAIL ME THE LISTS</a> or fork this repo on GitHub and create a pull request. </p></h4>
<h3> <p style="color:Blue;">What more can be done?</p></h3>
<h4><p>We could leave the Christmas lights up till January and add some details about the neighbourhood of the colleges and provide information about the availability of rooms/PGs and other stuffs so that the new students get at least an idea about the Visages, Villages (Faces Places).
<br/><br/> This is our place, we make the rules. You can share more ideas to make this database better.<br/></p></h4>
